Hello, I'm Neil! I'm currently a software engineer working on [Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) and [tools for sustainability](https://sustainability.google/) at Google in NYC.

Previously, I worked in [Goldman Sachs' Electronic Trading](https://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/ficc-and-equities/gset-equities) division and its Structured Products spinout [SIMON](https://www.simonmarkets.com/simon/).

Before that, I studied computer science at Columbia University, where I also built robot hardware and software.
